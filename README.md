# Self-Balancing-Monocycle-Vehicle
Development of a Self-Balancing Monocycle Vehicle. Bachelors monograph – Bachelors in Electronics Engineering, Federal University of Technology, Paraná. Ponta Grossa, 2015.  Due to the problem of chaos on traffic in Brazilian cities, technology, in special the control engineering, provides a possible solution. A self-balancing monocycle vehicle that provides autonomy, safety and portability, represents an alternative for users in big cities. The differences among linear and nonlinear controllers are presented for this vehicle, which may be characterized as a study of the one-wheeled inverted pendulum. Among the linear controllers, the design and simulation answers were obtained for PID and compensator controllers. For the nonlinear techniques, there are SDRE and SMC. The parameters of Gyroboy and of Large Motor EV3 from the LEGO® MINDSTORMS® EV3®set are shown, as well as the methods used to derive them. Since the users’ characteristics varies and due to being an embedded system, the robustness and energetic consumption are important requirements. Thus, the performances of all control techniques are compared for each requirement in five different parameters scenarios. The main element for choosing the best control technique proved to be the motor, which will act on the wheel of the vehicle, that depend on the hardware. Therefore nothing can be assumed without this information.
